This version of the clock-in program attempts to tackle the program more efficiently
using HashMaps and a more streamlined GUI setup
- HashInitialize.java to initialize HashMap and a file for HashClockIn.java to use
- HashClockIn.java to initialize file that contains clock-in
information for HashClockOut.java to use.
- HashClockOut.java to initialize file that contains clock-out 
information to make a final file
